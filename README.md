# TSP
Project: Optimal Routing for Efficient Shipment Delivery

Objective: Develop an optimization model using OR-Tools to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), ensuring the optimal routing of a single vehicle for efficient shipment delivery.

Process:

Implemented a TSP model with distance matrix calculations using the 'haversine' package for geographical coordinates.
Extended the model to handle different city sizes (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 70, 100).
Results:

Successfully optimized routes for various city sizes, achieving objectives such as 4,396 miles for 10 cities and 22,502 miles for 100 cities.
Recorded solution times for each iteration.
Key Achievements:

Developed a scalable TSP solution with logical constraints.
Automated result recording and analysis using Pandas.
These achievements showcase expertise in optimization, geographical routing, and efficient problem-solving, contributing to the field of logistics and operations research.
